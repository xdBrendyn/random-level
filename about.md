# Random Level

# Features
Two buttons added to the search area in the community tab that allow you to roll for a random level.

# DISCLAIMER
- PLEASE READ

In the making of this mod, I was rate limited by the boomlings host and this caused me to be banned from the geometry dash servers for an hour.

I then made this mod have a delay, so it doesn't look like a damn Ddos attack on the boomlings host. So if the mod feels a little slow, it's because each roll has a 1 second delay for each action it makes. This is so you're not sending tons of requests at once to the host, so you don't get banned.

- IMPORTANT

This does NOT mean you will 100% not be rate limited, I can't ensure that, but I have been using this mod myself in testing circumstances a lot, and with the delay haven't been rate limited at all anymore. So I am 99% sure you won't be rate limited with this mod, however to use it is at your own risk, if you are okay with the chance of being rate limited here and there.

# Smart RNG
Smart RNG accepts the filters in the search tab for you random roll, this can take a little longer than chaos mode, but will always give you a level with the filters you wanted, and will always be a known level.

If you use Smart RNG without any filters, it will automatically use Chaos RNG instead.

# Chaos RNG
Chaos RNG is simple; you click the button, and the mod will immedietely start trying random ID's until it gets a hit. This is true randomness, and will usually end up with you playing a level that you've never seen in your life.
